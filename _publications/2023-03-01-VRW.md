We propose a unified Augmented Reality (AR) based framework that combines the real-time physical multi-material simulation model and the efficient free-hand gesture interaction method. First, we employ a simple Red-Green-Blue-Depth (RGBD) camera to quickly acquire 3D environmental data to build the static boundary conditions. The real-time gestures are then detached and used as dynamic objects that interact with physical simulations. Finally, the calculated lighting parameters are used for real-time rendering and virtual-reality fusion. Our framework enables users to interact with various physical simu-lations in AR scenes, which considerably expands the applications of the fusion of AR and physical simulations.
